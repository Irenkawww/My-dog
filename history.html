          <p>
            The Yorkshire Terrier originated in Yorkshire. In the mid-nineteenth
            century, workers from Scotland came to Yorkshire in search of work
            and brought with them several varieties of terrier dogs. Breeding of
            the Yorkshire terrier was "principally accomplished by the people
            mostly operatives in cotton and woollen mills in the counties of
            Yorkshire and Lancashire." In the 1800s, miners wanting to develop a
            ratting terrier, bred Black-and-Tan Terriers with the Paisley and
            Clydesdale Terriers. Details are scarce. Mrs A. Foster is quoted as
            saying in 1886, "If we consider that the mill operatives who
            originated the breed were nearly all ignorant men, unaccustomed to
            imparting information for public use, we may see some reason why
            reliable facts have not been easily attained."
