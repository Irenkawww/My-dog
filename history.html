    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      The Yorkshire Terrier originated in Yorkshire. In the mid-nineteenth
      century, workers from Scotland came to Yorkshire in search of work and
      brought with them several varieties of terrier dogs. Breeding of the
      Yorkshire terrier was "principally accomplished by the people mostly
      operatives in cotton and woollen mills in the counties of Yorkshire and
      Lancashire." In the 1800s, miners wanting to develop a ratting terrier,
      bred Black-and-Tan Terriers with the Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers.
      Details are scarce. Mrs A. Foster is quoted as saying in 1886, "If we
      consider that the mill operatives who originated the breed were nearly all
      ignorant men, unaccustomed to imparting information for public use, we may
      see some reason why reliable facts have not been easily attained."
