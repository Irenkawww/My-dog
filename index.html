          <p>
            The Yorkshire Terrier is a British breed of toy dog of terrier type.
            It is among the smallest of the terriers and indeed of all dog
            breeds, with a weight of no more than 3.2 kg/7 pounds. It originated
            in the nineteenth century in the English county of Yorkshire, for
            which it is named. Their coats are typically tan on the head with a
            dark steel-grey body, but they can come in a variety of colors. It
            is a playful and energetic dog, usually kept as a companion dog. It
            has contributed to the development of other breeds including the
            Silky Terrier, and also to cross-breeds such as the Yorkipoo.

          <h2>Yorkshire Terrier colours</h2>
          <p>
            Yorkshire Terriers come in a very limited range of colours, and they
            almost always have a tan face and legs, with a dark blue or black
            “saddle” marking on their back. Most Yorkshire Terrier puppies are
            born with black and tan coats. As your Yorkie gets older, their coat
            will probably get lighter and become a blue and gold colour.

          <h2>Yorkshire Terrier temperament</h2>
          <p>
            Although they often look dainty and distinguished, Yorkshire
            Terriers still have a feisty terrier personality. The typical
            Yorkshire Terrier temperament is spirited and energetic, and they’re
            often described as a big dog in a little dog’s body. Despite their
            bold streak, Yorkshire Terriers are a loving and affectionate breed
            and will happily lap any attention you give them. Although they have
            become a lapdog in recent years, some Yorkshire Terriers still have
            traits of a working dog. They can have a high prey drive and might
            chase small animals. They’re also very alert and tend to bark at
            anything unusual.
          </p>
          <h2>How much exercise do Yorkshire Terriers need?</h2>
          <p>
            Yorkshire Terriers have a lot of energy so they need at least one
            brisk walk every day. However, they are only small, so they don’t
            need to be taken trekking to wear them out. You should expect to
            give your Yorkshire Terrier at least 30 to 45 minutes of walkies
            every day, and hopefully some playtime and enrichment too.

          <h2>How to groom a Yorkshire Terrier</h2>
          <p>
            Yorkshire Terrier grooming can be quite intense depending on their
            coat. Because their fur is naturally long and silky, it can tangle
            like human hair does. If your Yorkie has long fur, you will need to
            brush it once a day to make sure it doesn’t get knotted or matted.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a Yorkshire Terrier’s fur is clipped short, it doesn’t need as
            much brushing, and you can brush it every few days instead. If you
            do keep your Yorkshire Terrier’s clipped short, it will need less
            brushing, but more visits to the groomer. You’ll need to have their
            fur trimmed roughly every 6 weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for baths, you only need to wash your pooch whenever they’re
            visibly dirty or smelly. Just remember to brush them before bathing
            them to prevent their fur from getting tangled.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as brushing and trimming your Yorkie’s fur, you’ll need to
            trim their claws every month to prevent them from overgrowing. You
            should also brush their teeth regularly, ideally once a day, to get
            rid of bacteria and plaque and prevent

          <h2>Yorkshire Terrier lifespan</h2>
          <p>
            Yorkshire Terriers are one of the longest living dog breeds, with an
            average lifespan of 12-15 years. However, individual dogs have been
            known to reach their late teens!
          </p>
          <p>
            To help your dog live as long and healthy a life as possible,
            remember to provide them with a complete diet, daily exercise, and
            regular veterinary care.

                  are prone to skin and dietary allergies, which often manifest
                  as itchy skin and recurring ear infections. You may need to
                  pay for testing to identify and treat the cause of your pup’s

                <p>
                  are vulnerable to a few eye problems including dry eye and
                  cataracts. Occasionally, they might inherit conditions
                  including lens luxation or progressive retinal atrophy.
                  Cataracts and lens luxation require surgery to prevent vision
                  loss. Meanwhile, progressive retinal atrophy has no cure and
                  causes vision loss that may lead to blindness.

                <p>
                  is a condition where a dog’s kneecap moves out of place.
                  Sometimes it pops back into place on its own, other times
                  physiotherapy or surgery is required to correct the joint.
                  It’s common in most small breeds of dog, including the
