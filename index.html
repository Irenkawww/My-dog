            The Yorkshire Terrier is a British breed of toy dog of terrier type.
            It is among the smallest of the terriers and indeed of all dog
            breeds, with a weight of no more than 3.2 kg/7 pounds. It originated
            in the nineteenth century in the English county of Yorkshire, for
            which it is named. Their coats are typically tan on the head with a
            dark steel-grey body, but they can come in a variety of colors. It
            is a playful and energetic dog, usually kept as a companion dog. It
            has contributed to the development of other breeds including the
            Silky Terrier, and also to cross-breeds such as the Yorkipoo.

            <p>
              Although their long, silky fur gives them a regal appearance,
              Yorkshire Terriers were not aristocratic companions. These little
              dogs were bred to be rat catchers and were often found working in
              the mills across Yorkshire. Miners would also take these tiny dogs
              with them into coal mines, carrying them down in a bag or their
              pocket so the terrier could catch mice and rats down in the pit.

            <p>
              Yorkshire Terriers come in a very limited range of colours, and
              they almost always have a tan face and legs, with a dark blue or
              black “saddle” marking on their back. Most Yorkshire Terrier
              puppies are born with black and tan coats. As your Yorkie gets
              older, their coat will probably get lighter and become a blue and
              gold colour.

            <p>
              Although they often look dainty and distinguished, Yorkshire
              Terriers still have a feisty terrier personality. The typical
              Yorkshire Terrier temperament is spirited and energetic, and
              they’re often described as a big dog in a little dog’s body.
              Despite their bold streak, Yorkshire Terriers are a loving and
              affectionate breed and will happily lap any attention you give
              them. Although they have become a lapdog in recent years, some
              Yorkshire Terriers still have traits of a working dog. They can
              have a high prey drive and might chase small animals. They’re also
              very alert and tend to bark at anything unusual.

              Yorkshire Terriers have a lot of energy so they need at least one
              brisk walk every day. However, they are only small, so they don’t
              need to be taken trekking to wear them out. You should expect to
              give your Yorkshire Terrier at least 30 to 45 minutes of walkies
              every day, and hopefully some playtime and enrichment too.

            <summary class="list">How to groom a Yorkshire Terrier</summary>
            <p>
              Yorkshire Terrier grooming can be quite intense depending on their
              coat. Because their fur is naturally long and silky, it can tangle
              like human hair does. If your Yorkie has long fur, you will need
              to brush it once a day to make sure it doesn’t get knotted or
              matted.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a Yorkshire Terrier’s fur is clipped short, it doesn’t need
              as much brushing, and you can brush it every few days instead. If
              you do keep your Yorkshire Terrier’s clipped short, it will need
              less brushing, but more visits to the groomer. You’ll need to have
              their fur trimmed roughly every 6 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for baths, you only need to wash your pooch whenever they’re
              visibly dirty or smelly. Just remember to brush them before
              bathing them to prevent their fur from getting tangled.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as brushing and trimming your Yorkie’s fur, you’ll need to
              trim their claws every month to prevent them from overgrowing. You
              should also brush their teeth regularly, ideally once a day, to
              get rid of bacteria and plaque and prevent
