        The Yorkshire Terrier is a British breed of toy dog of terrier type. It
        is among the smallest of the terriers and indeed of all dog breeds, with
        a weight of no more than 3.2 kg/7 pounds. It originated in the
        nineteenth century in the English county of Yorkshire, for which it is
        named. Their coats are typically tan on the head with a dark steel-grey
        body, but they can come in a variety of colors. It is a playful and
        energetic dog, usually kept as a companion dog. It has contributed to
        the development of other breeds including the Silky Terrier, and also to
        cross-breeds such as the Yorkipoo.
