      The Yorkshire Terrier is a British breed of toy dog of terrier type. It is
      among the smallest of the terriers and indeed of all dog breeds, with a
      weight of no more than 3.2 kg/7 pounds. It originated in the nineteenth
      century in the English county of Yorkshire, for which it is named. Their
      coats are typically tan on the head with a dark steel-grey body, but they
      can come in a variety of colors. It is a playful and energetic dog,
      usually kept as a companion dog. It has contributed to the development of
      other breeds including the Silky Terrier, and also to cross-breeds such as
      the Yorkipoo.
